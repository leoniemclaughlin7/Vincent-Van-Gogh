        <p>
            Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most famous and influential figures in
            Western art history. Not commercially successful in his 
            career, he struggled with severe depression and poverty, which eventually led to his suicide at age thirty-seven.

                In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last
                two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and 
                dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art.
