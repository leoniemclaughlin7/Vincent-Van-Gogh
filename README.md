## Design

The objective of this project was to design a website that is easy to use and that has a clean layout whilst also sticking to the theme of the site. 

### Colours

The colour palette for this Vincent Van Gogh website was derived from the hero image. The hero image is a painting of Vincent Van Gogh with some of his iconic paintings in the background. The main colours that were used where white, black and varying shades of blue. A colour gradient was created using [Coolors.](https://coolors.co/gradient-palette/0e3c45-7ed0df?number=7)

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/coolors.png">

### Typography 

The fonts for the site where imported from Google fonts. For the headings [Shadows Into Light](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Shadows+Into+Light?query=shado) was used. This font was chosen as it fit the astetic of the site and the artist this site is based upon. For the main content [Kanit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kanit?query=kanit) was used. This font was chosen as it complements the heading whilst also being readable for the user. Both fonts also have a second font of Sans-Serif set incase the chosen fonts do not work on the users browser.  

# Features 

The Vincent Van Gogh website contains three main pages, which can be navagated too via a navigation bar that is fixed to the top of the page as the user scrolls. Each page contains a header with the navagation bar and a footer. The three main pages in this design are:

* Home/about section.
* Gallery.
* Sign up page. 

## Existing Features

### Header and Navigation Bar 

* Featured on all three pages, the header contains a clickable logo, that will return the user to the home page and a responsive navigation bar. 
* The navigation bar allows the user to move around the website and includes links to Home, About, Gallery and Sign up pages. A border can be seen on the page that the user is currently on. 
* The header is identical across all three pages which enhances usability and consistency.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/header.png">

### About Section

* The about section contains vital information for the user about the artists life and work. It is comprised of three sections to include a general about section, artist timeline and a video containing more information for the user.  
* In order to display the information but keep it minimal, the first part of the about section is displayed in two responsive boxes that fit with the colour scheme. 

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/about.png">

#### Artist Timeline

* The artist timeline is a responsive scrollable horizontal feature that gives the user more information releating to Vincent Van Gogh's life and events that happens in his life.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/artist-timeline.png">

#### Video

* The final section of the about section includes a video. This video gives the user more detail about Vincent Van Gogh, his life and work. 
* This video will not autoplay, instead it is up to the user to decide to play the video. It is appropriate to the website and is informative for users. 

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/video.png">

### Gallery 

* The gallery is an important aspect of this website. It is within this section that some of Vincents Van Gogh's paintings are displayed to the user.
* There is three distinct categories of paintings available to view, self-portraits, landscapes and flowers. When hovered over the paitings enlarge slightly and a drop shadow can be seen. 

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/gallery.png">


### Sign Up 

* The sign up page allows users to sign up to a newsletter that will supply them with more information regarding Vincent Van Gogh. 
* The sign up page is comprised of three input feilds and a checkbox, it contains form validation, in that either of the text feilds must not be empty. The email feild must contain an email and the checkbox must be checked before the form is submitted. 

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/sign-up.png">

### Form Submission Page

* When the user submits the sign up form they are redirected to a thank you page. 
* This gives an indication to the user that their form has been recieved and that they have signed up for the newsletter.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/form-thankyou.png">

## Features Left to Implement 

* A user profile could be implemented to allow the user to sign in to the website.
* It would be nice to add a feature that allows the user to favorite a painting.
* The addition of adding and viewing reviews of the paintings would be a nice feature to add.
* More of the work carried out by Vincent van Gogh could be added to the gallery.
